        id="text"> Click here to download your application!</a>
    <p>Click the link to download your application.</p>

    <p>When first clicking on the link, a pop-up will ask you to confirm that you want to
        download the application. You do.</p>
    <p>Then, the first time it's launched, a new pop-up will appear.</p>
    <p>iOS will ask if you trust the distributor of the app. Odds are you wouldn't have this link if you didn't.
        So, to confirm this and in order for the app to be usable, you will need to go to Settings > General >
        VPN
        and Device Management in your iOS device and you should see a section to click on to verify.</p>
