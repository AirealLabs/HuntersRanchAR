    <p>The first time users click on this link, a pop-up will be displayed on their screen to confirm that they want to

    <p>Then, the first time it's launched, a new pop-up will appear.</p>
    <p>iOS will ask them if they trust the distributor of the app, which in this case is you.
        To confirm this and in order for the app to be usable, they will have to go to the menu Settings > General >
        Profiles
        and Device Management in their iOS device.</p>
